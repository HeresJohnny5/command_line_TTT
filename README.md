# Command Line Tic Tac Toe Between Two Human Players

Before working on a Tic Tac Toe app I created a command line version of the game between two human players:

1. Player is asked if he/she wants to play Tic Tac Toe
2. The first player has the ability to choose if he/she wants to be either **X** or **O**
	* Feedback will prompt the first player to enter a valid character if he/she chooses anything other than **X** or **O**
3. Player one will chose a valid space between numbers one through nine
	* Feedback will prompt the first player to enter a valid move beteen numbers **one** through **nine**
4. Player one and Player two will alternate moves until either the **game_won?** or **game_tie?** function return true
